Hello! My name is Rachel Li and I am a 2nd year Psychology major at William & Mary. My psychology research interests include child emotion regulation, developmental psychopathology, emotion socialization, and the effects of immigration on child and adolescent mental health. I am also working towards a minor in Data Science. I am passionate about exploring the incorporation of data science techniques in psychological research. 

I am a bilingual learner and researcher seeking research and internship opportunities in both English and Chinese environments!
